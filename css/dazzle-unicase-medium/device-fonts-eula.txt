Device Limited End User License Agreement 

Quick overview:
* You must purchase the correct license for the correct number of users.
* If the circumstances of use change, the licence must be updated to reflect this.
* You must not open, edit or otherwise modify the font software ("converting to paths" and editing in a program such as Illustrator is permitted - just as long as the result is not converted back into font software for redistribution. Use of "converted to paths" type outlines for logos, headines etc is permitted).
* You cannot redistribute the font software.
* Editing and/or renaming the font software is not permitted - this does not constitute creating an original font and does not negate the terms of the original license. Device can provide custom font design, adaption and related licensing for all your needs.
* Using elements of the font as a basis of a new font is not permitted.
* If you wish the font to be used as part of a campaign or style bible, and need other agencies or individuals to use the same font, they will need to purchase the relevant licenses themselves from an authorized Device reseller. The correct way to do this is to list the URL of the reseller or Device (www.devicefonts.co.uk) in your material. 
* Respect copyright - the legal consequences of using unlicensed or adapted fonts can be very expensive and result in the enforced removal of all offending copies. Badly adapted fonts are often found to have a range of serious technical and design errors, the most common being missing kerning (contextual interletter spacing), missing characters, poor spacing, incorrect point construction (leading to printing problems and distorted character shapes), font ID clashes and missing counters due to incorrect path directions. Be legal, be safe.
